This folder contains all the DMX1A specific header files.

Files
-----
dmx1a_common_tie.h: DMX1A intrinsics interfaces generated by the Xtensa tools for use with Xtensa builds.
    There is no need to include it directly since it is included by TIE_include.h (see below).
dmx1a_version_tie.h: contains core definition item version and string. 
fr32_math.h: same as the C language <math.h> with modifications to support fr32 floating point.
fr32_utils.h: format conversions and other utilities.
fr32_xcc_ops.h: fr32 operator overloads.
TIE_defs.h: convenient definitions to use with TIE intrinsics.
TIE_include.h: includes deltamax_common_tie.h and extends it for functionality and ease of compilation.
    This is the file to include for Xtensa builds.
